HINT_USE_PLANETS_TITLE: Idle Planets
HINT_USE_PLANETS: <<|
	Level 0 planets cost money to maintain.
	
	Export resources from your low level planets to build up higher level ones,
	or abandon unused planets to free up your budget.
>>

HINT_COLONIZE_TITLE: Slow Colonization
HINT_COLONIZE: <<|
	Colonization requires populations and costs money. When in debt, the rate of colonization
	can be greatly slowed.
	
	Focus on colonizing a small number of planets at first and grow those planets to support further
	colonization. You may also cancel colonization orders to speed up the remaining orders.

	Manage the groups of support ships currently assigned to the planet.

	[b]Colonize[/b]

	Send 1B population from the planet to another unoccupied planet to colonize it.

DEFENSE_TARGET: Build Defense
TT_DEFENSE_TARGET: <<|
	[b]Build Defense for...[/b]

	Instead of building defense ships around the planet itself, build defense ships
	for use in another target system you control.

PLANET_POPULATION_TIP: <<|
	[b]Population[/b]
	
	How many Billion people live on the planet. The more population a planet has, the higher its base income and pressure capacity.
>>

PLANET_INCOME_TIP: <<|
	[b]Income[/b]
	
	The amount of money this planet makes or loses every budget cycle.

PLANET_DEFENSE_TIP: <<|
	[b]Defense[/b]
	
	Periodically builds free defense support ships around the planet, or planets in
	whichever other system this planet is set to produce defense for.
>>

PLANET_LOYALTY_TIP: <<|
	[b]Loyalty[/b]

	Loyalty indicates how dedicated your subjects on this planet are.

	Sieging a planet will gradually reduce its loyalty until it hits 0, after
	which it will be captured by the sieging empire.

	The more loyal a planet, the more influence it takes to annex.
>>

PLANET_PRESSURE_TIP: <<|
	[b]Pressure[/b]

	Planetary resources can provide pressure to their consuming planet.

	Your civilian population will construct resource production buildings for
	every pressure available to the planet.

	Planets can only sustain up to a maximum capacity of pressure, dependent on
	the planet level and total population. Pressure imported beyond the
	pressure capacity will be used at reduced efficiency.

	Exporting a planet's native resource will reduce its pressure capacity as
	an additional cost.

PLANET_LABOR_TIP: <<|
	[b]Labor[/b]
	
	Labor affects the rate of construction at the planet.

PLANET_RESEARCH_TIP: <<|
	[b]Research[/b]
	
	Generates progress toward the next research point.
	Research points are spent to unlock nodes in the research graph.
