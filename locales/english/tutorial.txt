TUT_INTRO_TITLE: 3876 CE: The Terran Empire
TUT_INTRO_TEXT: <<|
	"A glorious age dawns in the empire's fourth millennium!
	
	The discovery and colonization of the New Galaxy is well underway and
	proceeding smoothly, attracting people from all over the empire to settle
	on rich frontier worlds and try to improve their lot.

	Or so the newslinks say..."
>>
TUT_INTRO2_TITLE: 3876 CE: The Terran Empire
TUT_INTRO2_TEXT: <<|
	"In truth, the frontier is a cesspool of outlaws, petty criminals, and
	lawyers, and the empire is frequently forced to send fleets to maintain
	order - Fleets sent under the guise of protecting settlements in unclaimed
	space from the Xu'sio alien menance.

	Of course, this enforced lawfulness only lasts as long as the duration of
	the fleet's deployment, the colonies quickly reverting to their brutish
	ways of robbery, murder and class action lawsuits.
	
	Most EarthFleet commanders had given up on the prospect of reforming the
	frontier entirely..."
>>
TUT_INTRO3_TITLE: 3876 CE: The Terran Empire
TUT_INTRO3_TEXT: <<|
	"But not Commodore Hople of the proud 119th fleet.

	No, our commander had wanted change and stability on the frontier, and was
	prepared to take a radical approach. The Commodore had flown a shuttle down
	to the planet's largest city to discuss plans and terms with the settlers.

	Commodore Hople had promptly died of dysentery.

	Unfortunately, this left me in charge of the fleet's mission."

TUT_CAM_TITLE: Controlling the Camera
TUT_CAM_TEXT: <<|
	Familiarize yourself with the command console's viewscreen. Commanding your
	forces might prove difficult if you cannot see them.
	
	[i]If the tutorial is in the way at any time, you may drag it around by its top bar.[/i]
>>
TUT_CAM_ACT1_TITLE: Look Around
TUT_CAM_ACT1_TEXT: Move the cursor to the [color=#0f0]edge of the screen[/color] or use [color=#0f0]WASD[/color].
TUT_CAM_ACT2_TITLE: Zoom In and Out
TUT_CAM_ACT2_TEXT: Scroll with the [color=#0f0]mouse wheel[/color] or hold [b]both mouse buttons[/b] and [b]drag[/b].
TUT_CAM_ACT3_TITLE: Rotate the View
TUT_CAM_ACT3_TEXT: Hold the [color=#0f0]right mouse button[/color] and [color=#0f0]drag[/color].

TUT_SCAN_TITLE: Driving them Out
TUT_SCAN_TEXT: <<|
	The flagship's long-range sensors have picked up a Xu'sio FTL gate being
	flown into the system, protected by a two small defense fleets.

	Destroy the gate and prevent it from deploying more enemy assault fleets!
>>
TUT_SCAN_ACT1_TITLE: Select your Fleet
TUT_SCAN_ACT1_TEXT: [color=#0f0]Left click[/color] the flagship to select the fleet.
TUT_SCAN_ACT2_TITLE: Destroy the Enemy Fleet
TUT_SCAN_ACT2_TEXT: [color=#0f0]Right click[/color] an enemy fleet and select [color=#0f0#]Attack[/color].
TUT_SCAN_ACT3_TITLE: Destroy the Enemy Gate
TUT_SCAN_ACT3_TEXT: [color=#0f0]Attack[/color] and destroy all enemy fleets and the enemy FTL Gate.

TUT_FTL_TITLE: Returning to Base
TUT_FTL_TEXT: <<|
	The colony we're protecting is situated in a neighbouring system, [b]Lihls[/b].
	It's about time we get over there and boss them around a little.
	
	We should use our flagship's hyperdrives to FTL there, rather than spending
	an eternity crossing the void in sublight.
>>
TUT_FTL2_TITLE: Returning to Base
TUT_FTL2_TEXT: <<|
	Use of all methods of FTL travel is limited by the availability of
	[color=#00c0ff][img=ResourceIcon::3;20/] FTL Energy[/color]. This energy is
	harvested through use of special tuning crystals, found on only a few
	planets in the galaxy, and then superluminally transmitted to the ships
	authorized to use it.

	The further away you try to jump, the more energy it costs. Try ordering
	your fleet to use their hyperdrives, draining your stored ftl energy.
>>
TUT_FTL2_ACT1_TITLE: FTL to Lihls
TUT_FTL2_ACT1_TEXT: <<|
	With your fleet selected, press the '$1' key or click the hyperdrive button
	in the bottom left to order an ftl jump.
>>

TUT_ARRIVE_TITLE: Captain's Log
TUT_ARRIVE_TEXT: <<|
	"Arriving at the colony, we held a brief funeral ceremony for our commodore
	- now posthumously promoted to Rear Admiral. The local undertaker had done
	a good job covering the charred laser wound on his forehead.

	It was decided that the fleet would continue to support the settlement and
	its expansion into the local area of space until the Terran Empire
	officially claimed the region."
>>

TUT_RES_TITLE: Resources
TUT_RES_TEXT: <<|
	Most planets in the galaxy contain the natural resources to produce
	a single particular type of resource in quantities large enough for
	a sustained export industry.

	Resources range from food and water, to supercarbons and uranium, to FTL
	crystals. Not every resource can be produced right away, and some resources
	require a higher [b]level[/b] planet in order to produce.
>>

TUT_LEVEL_TITLE: Expanding and Developing
TUT_LEVEL_TEXT: <<|
	Every settled planet has a [b]level[/b], ranging from level 0 to level 4.
	Planet levels indicate the amount of infrastructure, population and
	development a planet possesses, and higher level planets are better in many
	ways.

	In order to level up a planet, it requires access to more and more
	resources, imported from different planets. The most basic of resource
	requirements are [b]Food and Water[/b].
>>
TUT_LEVEL2_TITLE: Expanding and Developing
TUT_LEVEL2_TEXT: <<|
	When you export a resource, the original planet no longer has access to
	that resource for its own use.

	Because planets require resources from other planets to level up, not every
	planet can be a high-level powerhouse. It is important to carefully choose
	which planets to send resources to, and which higher level resources to
	start producing.

	In our case, we want to level up Spacewood to level 2 to gain extra income
	and population.
>>

TUT_EXPAND_TITLE: Colonizing and Exporting
TUT_EXPAND_TEXT: <<|
	Unlike most planets, Spacewood has access to [b]3[/b] native resources:
	Water, Meat and Native Gold.
	
	To sustain a planet at Level 1, it requires a [b]Food[/b] and
	a [b]Water[/b]. This makes Spacewood a rich world that can natively sustain
	level 1 without requiring imports. In order to reach [b]Level 2[/b], we need to
	use the Native Gold and another Food.
>>
TUT_EXPAND_ACT1_TITLE: Colonize a Food
TUT_EXPAND_ACT1_TEXT: <<|
	[b]Select[/b] Spacewood, then right click one of the Food planets in the system
	and select the colonization option.
>>
TUT_EXPAND_ACT2_TITLE: Import the Food
TUT_EXPAND_ACT2_TEXT: <<|
	[b]Select[/b] the planet you colonized, then [b]right-click[/b] Spacewood
	and click the export option.
>>

TUT_EXPAND_SUCC_TITLE: Success!
TUT_EXPAND_SUCC_TEXT: <<|
	Congratulations! You succesfully developed Spacewood to a Level 2 world,
	increasing its maximum population.

	When you select a planet, you can see its current level and the required
	imports to level it up on the information panel in the bottom left.

	Keep in mind that resources can only be imported and exported within the
	same [b]Trade Region[/b], indicated by the grey borders. Your trade border
	will expand as you colonize more systems.
>>

TUT_BUDGET_TITLE: Budget Cycles
TUT_BUDGET_TEXT: <<|
	Building, purchasing and maintaining things costs
	[b][color=#d1cb6a][img=ResourceIcon::0;20/] Money[/color][/b].

	Money, like most resources, is produced by your civilian population and
	infrastructure. The higher a planet's population, the more money it makes.
>>
TUT_BUDGET2_TITLE: Budget Cycles
TUT_BUDGET2_TEXT: <<|
	Your income is budgeted along 3-minute [b]Budget Cycles[/b]. Every cycle,
	your budget is re-calculated and you will gain use of any money you netted,
	to spend over the next 3 minutes.

	Any money not spent at the end of a budget cycle will instead be spent on
	one of the welfare options you can choose in the resource bar.
	
	It is not possible to save money from one budget cycle to the next, but
	borrowing money as an advance from an upcoming cycle is possible, at
	a hefty markup.
>>

TUT_BUILD_TITLE: Building a Scout
TUT_BUILD_TEXT: <<|
	We should build a scout to check out what's going on in Xaste, another
	system neighbouring Spacewood. The enemy may be trying to sneak in another
	FTL gate.
>>
TUT_BUILD_ACT1_TITLE: Manage the Planet
TUT_BUILD_ACT1_TEXT: <<|
	Open the planet management screen on Spacewood by [b]double-clicking[/b]
	it, or clicking the 'Manage Planet' button in the bottom left.
>>
TUT_BUILD_ACT2_TITLE: Construct a Scout
TUT_BUILD_ACT2_TEXT: <<|
	Click the "Scout (16)" ship design from the ship construction list on the
	right to start construction.
>>

TUT_BUILD2_TITLE: Reinforcing a Fleet
TUT_BUILD2_TEXT: <<|
	Note how the Scout design indicated it would cost [img=ResourceIcon::0;20/]
	§40k / §69k. The first number indicates its [b]Build Cost[/b] is §40k,
	which you will need to spend immediately from your available budget. The
	second number is its [b]Maintenance Cost[/b], the §69k will be subtracted
	as a maintenance cost from each subsequent budget.

	While we wait for our Scout to finish constructing, lets order some
	additional [b]Support Ships[/b] for our original Titan's fleet.
>>
TUT_BUILD2_ACT1_TITLE: Exit Planet Management
TUT_BUILD2_ACT1_TEXT: Close the planet management screen by [b]right-clicking[/b].

TUT_SCOUT_TITLE: Scouting Xaste
TUT_SCOUT_TEXT: <<|
	Great! The fleet will automatically order its queued support groups from
	any nearby planets with labor generation. Different flagships can support
	differing amounts of supports, as indicated by the [b]"Support Capacity"[/b]
	indicator above the supports list.

	While our fleet is being reinforced, we'll want to send our scout to take
	a peek at the enemy.
>>
TUT_SCOUT_ACT1_TITLE: Scout Xaste
TUT_SCOUT_ACT1_TEXT: <<|
	Send your newly constructed scout to the Xaste system. Use its hyperdrive
	if you want to.
>>

TUT_CONQ_TITLE: Conquering Xaste
TUT_CONQ_TEXT: <<|
	Our scout has detected an enemy colony in the Xaste system, occupying
	a Phasite planet. Phasite is a level 0 resource that gives Research.
	
	Since there don't seem to be any major defense fleets around, we should
	send in our fleet to take the planet by force: Kill the planet's own
	defense ships, then lay siege to it with your fleet to reduce its loyalty.
	When its loyalty is completely drained, the planet will be yours!
>>
TUT_CONQ_ACT1_TITLE: Jump Titan into Xaste
TUT_CONQ_ACT1_TEXT: Jump your Titan fleet into the Xaste system using its hyperdrives.
TUT_CONQ_ACT2_TITLE: Eliminate Defenses
TUT_CONQ_ACT2_TEXT: Move your fleet to Xaste IV and eliminate the defense ships in orbit.
TUT_CONQ_ACT3_TITLE: Capture Planet
TUT_CONQ_ACT3_TEXT: Select your fleet, then [b]right-click[/b] Xaste IV and select the "Capture" option. Wait for your fleet to finish capturing the planet.

TUT_CAPT_TITLE: Victory!
TUT_CAPT_TEXT: <<|
	The enemy planet has succumbed to your fleet's siege! The colony is now yours to command.

	In order to use the Phasite it is producing and start generating research, export it to Spacewood.
>>
TUT_CAPT_ACT1_TITLE: Export Phasite
TUT_CAPT_ACT1_TEXT: Export Xaste IV's Phasite to Spacewood.

TUT_PRES_TITLE: Resources and Pressures
TUT_PRES_TEXT: <<|
	In addition to planets requiring particular types of resources to level up,
	resources can provide their consuming planet with [b]Pressure[/b].
	
	Civilian population on the planet will automatically develop [b]Civilian
	Buildings[/b] on the planet's surface to produce the type of pressure being
	imported (one of Money, Influence, Energy, Research, Defense, or Labor).

	Planets can only support a limited amount of pressure, dependent on their
	total population. Importing more pressure than a planets capacity will
	result in lost production efficiency.
>>

TUT_BLD_TITLE: Imperial Buildings
TUT_BLD_TEXT: <<|
	Although most of your production will be from civilian infrastructure, it
	is possible to spend parts of your budget on constructing [b]Imperial
	Buildings[/b] on planet surfaces.

	These buildings generally cost a lot of money to build and maintain, but
	can give benefits that you would not otherwise be able to get.
>>

TUT_RSC_TITLE: Researching Fields
TUT_RSC_TEXT: <<|
	Research points you generate can be put into any of a number of [b]Research
	Fields[/b], in order to level them up. By leveling up research fields, you
	gain passive benefits to various parts of your empire, as well as being
	able to gain special research projects and unlocks.

	The rightmost part of the resource bar underneath the tab bar displays the
	current field being researched, and the progress until the next level.

TUT_INS_TITLE: Research Insights
TUT_INS_TEXT: <<|
	As you level up fields, you will gain access to special [b]Research
	Projects[/b]. Researching projects can give you various special benefits.
	
	A lot of research projects require you to spend [b]Insight[/b] to unlock
	them. As you level up fields, you will randomly gain particular types of
	Insight. Theoretical Insights can be used to satisfy requirements for any
	non-Ancient type of insight.
>>
TUT_INS_ACT1_TITLE: Unlock Control Computer

TUT_DSG_TITLE: Ship Designs
TUT_DSG_TEXT: <<|
	Every ship you build, flagship or support ship, is based on a design. In
	order to build ships equipped with our recently unlocked Control Computer,
	we need to change one of our designs to use it.

	Designs consist of a number of hexes on a blueprint, and subsystems placed
	on those hexes. It is up to you to determine how large a subsystem is by
	'painting' it on the blueprint, ranging from creating tiny 1-hex sized
	laser turrets to giant spinal lasers covering most of the internals of the
	ship.
>>

TUT_FLT_ACT5_TITLE: Finish Construction
TUT_FLT_ACT5_TEXT: Notice that support ships are constructed in parallel to the flagship while the fleet finishes constructing.

TUT_ENG_TITLE: Energy and Artifacts
TUT_ENG_TEXT: <<|
	Particular resources in your empire will produce [b]Energy[/b]. This
	represents massive quantities of stored energy that you can transmit and
	use to activate ancient remnant devices, scattered across the galaxy.

	We detected a [b]Power Cell[/b] in the Xaste system, which we can equip to
	upgrade our new fleet by spending energy.

TUT_INF_TITLE: Diplomatic Actions
TUT_INF_TEXT: <<|
	You can conduct diplomacy by spending [b]Influence[/b] points, generated on
	your planets by particular resources found throughout the galaxy. These
	points are used to purchase and activate [b]Diplomatic Actions[/b].
>>
TUT_INF2_TITLE: The Influence Stack
TUT_INF2_TEXT: <<|
	All empires purchase their [b]Diplomatic Actions[/b] from a shared list on
	the diplomacy tab, called the [b]"Influence Stack"[/b]. At regular
	intervals, new cards are added to the right side of the stack, and cards
	will drop off and disappear from the left side.

	Diplomatic actions become cheaper to purchase the longer they spend in the
	influence stack, but be careful of waiting too long to buy attractive cards
	- other empires may snatch them up first!
>>
TUT_INF3_TITLE: Purchasing an Action
TUT_INF3_TEXT: <<|
	We want to see what our enemy, the Xu'sio is up to in this region.
	Fortunately, there is a [b]Spy[/b] card on the influence stack right now,
	which we can use to gain vision over their activities.

TUT_INF4_TITLE: Spying
TUT_INF4_TEXT: <<|
	Notice how the "Spy" effect was added to the list of currently active
	influence effects. Long-term diplomatic effects usually require an
	[b]Influence Upkeep[/b].

	In this case, your "Spy" effect is reducing your influence point generation
	by 20% until it expires or is dismissed.
>>

TUT_SPY_TITLE: Enemy System Spotted!

TUT_ANNEX_ACT1_TITLE: Activate Annex System
TUT_ANNEX_ACT1_TEXT: Activate the [b]Annex System[/b] card you have, then select the Yingmow system by clicking its star.

TUT_VOTE_TITLE: Influence Votes
TUT_VOTE_TEXT: <<|
	Certain diplomatic actions require you to pass [b]Votes[/b] in the galactic
	senate in order for them to take effect. Annexing a system is one of these votes.

	All votes have a current [b]Support Level[/b], indicating the sum of all
	their support reduced by their opposition. Most of the time, a vote will
	start at +1 support.

	Empires can pay influence to play [b]Support Cards[/b] into a vote,
	increasing or reducing the support level or adding various special effects.
>>
TUT_VOTE2_TITLE: Passing a Vote
TUT_VOTE2_TEXT: <<|
	While an influence vote, or "Proposition", has a positive support level,
	its [b]Vote Timer[/b] will count upwards. When the vote timer reaches
	3 minutes of positive support, the vote [b]Passes[/b].

	When the support level is negative, the [b]Vote Timer[/b] will count down.
	When it reaches negative 3 minutes, the vote will [b]Fail[/b].

	Influence votes are a diplomatic tug-of-war that any empire in the galactic
	senate can influence the result of.
>>
TUT_VOTE3_TITLE: Supporting a Vote
TUT_VOTE3_TEXT: <<|
	The Xu'sio have used one of their "Rhetoric" actions to gather opposition
	to your annex vote in the Senate. Quick, use one of your own actions to get
	the [b]Support Level[/b] back in the green before the vote goes down to
	[b][color=#f00]-3 minutes[/color][/b] and fails.

TUT_ANNEX2_TITLE: Annexation Complete!
TUT_ANNEX2_TEXT: <<|
	By convincing the Galactic Senate that the Yingmow system belongs to you,
	you've successfully [b]Annexed[/b] it. The colonized planets in the system
	are now yours!

	Unfortunately, sources within the Terran Empire have informed us of a large
	Xu'sio military movement towards the Yingmow system, so we should prepare
	our defenses to repel them.

TUT_DEFPROJ_TEXT: <<|
	The Spacewood locals have informed us that they've set up a means of
	creating defense ships to protect themselves. Planets with [b]Defense
	Generation[/b] will periodically spawn support ships in orbit to protect
	the planet from invaders.

	Planets with defense can also be ordered to build defenses for other
	systems, causing the generated support ships to spawn in orbit of planets
	in the targeted system instead.
