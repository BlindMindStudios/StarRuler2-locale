TT_MANAGE_PLANET: <<|

	Manage the groups of support ships currently assigned to the planet.

	Send 1B population from one of your planets to this planet to colonize it.

DEFENSE_TARGET: Build Defense
TT_DEFENSE_TARGET: <<|
	[b]Build Defense for...[/b]

	Instead of building defense ships around the planet itself, build defense ships
	for use in another target system you control.
>>

PLANET_POPULATION_TIP: <<|
	[b]Population[/b]
	
	How many Billion people live on the planet. The more population a planet has, the higher its base income and pressure capacity.
>>

PLANET_INCOME_TIP: <<|
	[b]Income[/b]
	
	The amount of money this planet makes or loses every budget cycle.
>>

PLANET_INFLUENCE_TIP: <<|
	[b]Influence[/b]
	
	Generates influence for your empire.
	Influence is used to affect other empires diplomatically.
>>

PLANET_ENERGY_TIP: <<|
	[b]Energy[/b]
	
	Energy is used to activate artifacts found around the galaxy.
>>

PLANET_DEFENSE_TIP: <<|
	[b]Defense[/b]
	
	Periodically builds free defense support ships around the planet, or planets in
	whichever other system this planet is set to produce defense for.
>>

PLANET_LOYALTY_TIP: <<|
	[b]Loyalty[/b]

	Loyalty indicates how dedicated your subjects on this planet are.

	Sieging a planet will gradually reduce its loyalty until it hits 0, after
	which it will be captured by the sieging empire.

	The more loyal a planet, the more influence it takes to annex.
>>

PLANET_PRESSURE_TIP: <<|
	[b]Pressure[/b]

	Planetary resources can provide pressure to their consuming planet.

	Your civilian population will construct resource production buildings for
	every pressure available to the planet.

	Planets can only sustain up to a maximum capacity of pressure, dependent on
	the planet level and total population. Pressure imported beyond the
	pressure capacity will be used at reduced efficiency.

	Exporting a planet's native resource will reduce its pressure capacity as
	an additional cost.
>>

PLANET_LABOR_TIP: <<|
	[b]Labor[/b]
	
	Labor affects the rate of construction at the planet.
>>

PLANET_RESEARCH_TIP: <<|
	[b]Research[/b]
	
	Generates progress toward the next research point.
	Research points are spent to unlock nodes in the research graph.
>>

PLANET_DESIGNATION_TIP: <<|
	[b]Wonder[/b]
	
	Planets that reach Level 4 can choose to construct a wonder. This replaces
	the planet's native resources and grants an empire-wide effect.

	Choosing a wonder will lock in all the resources being exported to the
	planet, making you unable to change their destinations.
>>

PLANET_WONDER_REQ: Wonder: Level 4 planet required...
PLANET_WONDER_CHOOSE: Choose Wonder...

PLANET_REQUIREMENTS_TIP: <<|
	[b]Level Requirements[/b]
	
	Importing these types of resources to this planet will cause it
