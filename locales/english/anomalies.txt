ANOMALY_DEBRIS_FIELD: Debris Field
ANOMALY_NAR_DEBRIS: <<|
	Amongst the vast amounts of ancient wreckage, a lone signal flickers in and
	out of detection.
>>

ANOMALY_NAR_DERELICT_BROKEN: <<|
	Locating the source of the signal, you find the wreck of an ancient warship.

	The ship appears to be heavily damaged, but perhaps we can find something useful on board.
>>
ANOMALY_DERELICT_SCRAP: <<|
	Scrap the warship for parts and sell the technology on the black market.

	[b][color=#d1cb6a][right]Gain ยง$1k[/right][/color][/b]

	[b][color=#842cdb][right]Gain a random amount of research points.[/right][/color][/b]
>>
ANOMALY_NAR_DERELICT_INTACT: <<|
	Locating the source of the signal, you find a mostly intact ancient warship.

	Since the ship's programming is alien to us, reactivating it may have
	unintended consequences.
>>
ANOMALY_DERELICT_ACTIVATE: <<|
	Attempt to activate and gain control of the warship.

	[b][color=#ff0000][right]Unknown results.[/right][/color][/b]
>>
ANOMALY_DERELICT_CAMP: <<|
	After some repairs to the core engine system, the warship activates and
	whirs to life.

	Unfortunately, the advanced AI programming rejects your engineers,
	jettisoning them into space and resuming its automated defense tasks.
>>
ANOMALY_DERELICT_DRYDOCK: <<|
	The warship's internals appear to have been damaged more than we
	anticipated and will require intensive refitting.

	Fortunately, we've been able to decode the ship's programming in the mean
	time. We will be able to fully operate the ship once its reconstruction has
	completed.
>>
ANOMALY_DERELICT_SUPPORTS: <<|
	After activating the warship's core computer, its AI programming detects
	the critical state of the engine system and autonomously launches its
	support ships from the hangar.

	Our engineers manage to evacuate in time to avoid the blast from the ship's
	destruction, but not after obtaining the control codes to the automated
	support ships.
>>

ANOMALY_NAR_ANCIENT_GATE: <<|
	A minor gravitational anomaly has lead to the discovery of a massive, heavily worn ring
	floating in space. The device's outer structure has decayed to a mere thin shell, the
	result of suspected eons of stellar radiation and micro-impacts.
	
	The ring's interior is composed of various unknown materials, though the remaining
	detectable fields are reminiscent of hyperlight distortions.
>>
ANOMALY_GATE_ACTIVATE: <<|

	are still broadcasting a request for orders, but its mining equipment has
	been damaged beyond repair by weapons fire.
>>
ANOMALY_NAR_MINING_OUTPOST_VOLAT: <<|
	An abandoned mining outpost sits dormant on a large asteroid. Its systems
	are still broadcasting a request for orders, but its mining equipment has
	been damaged beyond repair by weapons fire.

	Your sensors detect a faint reading of an unknown reactive material below
	the layer of minerals that were being mined.
>>

>>

ANOMALY_NAR_RIFT: <<|
	You encounter a strange station periodically emitting tachyon pulses at
	a nearby spatial anomaly. The station's power system appears functional,
	but the emitter's focusing mechanism is damaged.

	If we repair the emitter, we may be able to widen the spatial anomaly
	enough to pass through it.
>>

>>

ANOMALY_NAR_PLANT: <<|
	Within the debris you quickly detect a station of intriguing design.

	Controlling dozens of drones, the station systematically severs and
	collects parts of the debris, using processes unknown to us to refine the
	material into gel-like chemicals.

	At one point during your studies, the station launched a capsule containing
	some of the chemicals into the system at great velocity. Study of the
	capsule's trajectory revealed its slingshot course around one of the
	planets and into interstellar space.
>>
ANOMALY_PLANT_SIPHON: <<|
	Quickly drill a small hole into the hull around one of the chemical stores
	and siphon it off for study and potential use.

	[b][color=#ff0000][right]Unknown results.[/right][/color][/b]
>>

	greatly increase the food production of one of your planets.

	[color=#96d16a]You have gained one [b]Cultivation[/b] influence card.[/color]

	Unfortunately, subsequent attempts to siphon more chemicals were detected
	and the station activated its self-destruct mechanisms in response to your
	interference.
>>
ANOMALY_PLANT_SIPHON_FAIL: <<|
	The chemical you attempted to siphon turned out to be highly explosive and
	detonated with the drill attempt. The station could not sustain hull
	integrity and was destroyed.

	Fortunately, your scientists foresaw the possibility, and none of your
	crew was killed in the explosion.
>>

	Wait for another capsule to be launched and intercept it before it leaves
	the system.

	shipment, and continues to refine materials from the debris field.
>>
ANOMALY_PLANT_CATCH_FAIL: <<|
	Detecting your interference with its shipments, the station docks all its
	drones and arms its weapons. Get ready for combat!
>>

	sensor system. After setting its alien atmosphere on fire and purging our
	scientists, the station docks all its drones and arms its weapons.
>>
ANOMALY_PLANT_BOARDED: <<|
	Your boarding party has succesfully infiltrated the station.

	The station appears to contain an alien kind of atmosphere, consisting
	of a large amount of reactive elements.

	Exploring the station's insides, your scientists discover a large amount of
	distinct chemical stores, but the readings on the majority of them do not suggest
	any viable use for our species.
>>
ANOMALY_PLANT_BOARD_HAPPY: <<|
	Readings suggest that a particular chemical stored on the station is
	extremely beneficial for consumption by our species, inducing a greater
	lifespan.
